# PaceRobotics
A robotics program for graduate students in Educational Technology at Pace University.

## Welcome!
We are going to spend four weeks learning how to program robots and then show off what we know in a competition.

## Our Robot
![The mBot](http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mBot-Educational-Robot.jpg)

For this program, we are using the [mBot](http://learn.makeblock.cc/mbot/), an [Arduino based](https://www.arduino.cc/) robot which is easy to assemble and program, but which is also capable of doing some very complex things. 
It comes with three sensors. An ultrasound sensor lets it determine how far it is from something. A light sensor lets it determine how bright (or dark) a place is. And a line sensor lets it determine the difference between light and dark things is rolls over.

## The Challenges
You will be learning how to program your mBot first by learning some of the basics. Then, you and your fellow students will be working to compete in two challenges. 

### The Dance Off Challenge
In the Dance Off Challenge, you will program your robot to dance to a song of your choosing. The song must last at least two minutes. You will then upload your code, a video of your robot dancing, and a reflection to Pace Commons.

### The Dealer's Choice Challenge
In the Dealer's Choice Challenge, you and will program your robot to do something of your own choosing. It should show off your programming skills and be cool, innovative, and creative. You will then upload your code, a video of your robot dancing, and a reflection to Pace Commons.

## The Program
Here is what we will be up to each week of the program.

### [Week 1](/Week1Pace.md)
1. Introduction to this robotics program.
2. Introduction to the mBot.
3. Basics of programming your mBot.

### [Week 2](https://github.com/drardito/MtVernonRobotics/blob/master/Week2Pace.md)
1. More basics of mBot programming.
2. Planning for your Dance-Off Challenge

### [Week 3](https://github.com/drardito/MtVernonRobotics/blob/master/Week3Pace.md)
1. Choose your challenge.
2. Decide on a song for the Dance Off and begin planning your dance routine.
3. Decide on a Dealers Choice challenge and begin planning your programming.

### Week 4
1. Completing the Dealer's Choice Challenge (and reflection)
2. Celebrating your new robotics skills.
