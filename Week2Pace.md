#Welcome to Week 2
This week, we will be focusing on two things:

1. Learning more about how to program our mBots.
2. Beginning to plan for the two challenges.
   *Dance Off
   *Dealer's Choice

##Getting to work
The mBot folks have put together a book which has a set of exercises that will teach you to program your mBot.
You can download the book [here] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/3dwpdyt1ygrpi3t/mBlock%20Kids%20maker%20rocks%20with%20the%20robots.pdf?dl=0).

###Some practice
Once you have downloaded the book, you can start to work through the exercises.
You can do whichever ones you wish, but you MUST successfully complete:
  1. Chapter 9 - Run Robot!
  2. Chapter 10 - Dodging Master
  3. Chapter 11 - The Success Road
  4. Chapter 12 - Obedient Robot
  5. Chapter 13 - The Versatile Robot

##What's Next
When you work your way through each of these, it's time for a mini-challenge - a race.
For details, see Chapter 14.

##Leaving Breadcrumbs
To complete this work, upload your code for these programs, along with photos and/or video of your robot at work, and a reflection to Pace Commons.
