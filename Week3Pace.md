#Welcome to Week 3!
After all the preparation and learning you have been doing, it is time to attack the two challenges: **Dance Off** and **Dealer's Choice**.
You can see the challenges [here] (https://github.com/drardito/MtVernonRobotics/blob/master/OverviewPace.md).
For the **Dealer's Choice Challenge,** feel free to design something you might want to use with your students.

##A Week of Challenges
So, you are going to spend this week programming your robot to meet both challenges.
Then, you will share your work. See below for details.

##Sharing your work
You are going to share your work in a variety of ways:
  1. **Reflect.** You will maintain a reflective journal via blog posts on [Pace Commons](/http://pacecommons.org/). Use his journal to share about your learning and challenges and learning from challenges.
  2. **Upload.**  You will share your code with us by uploading it somewhere and then posting a link on Pace Commons. 
  3. **Show and Tell.** When your robot is doing what you want it to do, please take photos and videos and share them with us on Pace Commons.

##Learning in Community
One of the best pedagogical things are teaching with robotics is the way that a community gets formed. I encourage you to reach out to me and each other as you are working with your robotics. The more the merrier!
